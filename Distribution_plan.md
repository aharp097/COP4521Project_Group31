From what we could gather, Docker is a popular choice to pair with Django apps, and has a plethora of tutorials on YouTube as well as a lively forum which makes it more beginner-friendly than other options. We learned about Docker simply from browsing YouTube on the topic of containerization for Django applications. <br> In addition to the rich learning resources, Docker plays nice with other machines due to instructions being contained within the Docker image, so transferring hosts is easier than with other solutions. To make an image, when we’re in the python environment for our project (venv), we need to run the command <br><blockquote>pip freeze > requirements.txt<br></blockquote> This will generate a text file named “requirements.txt” that includes which packages and versions are necessary to run the Django app. After that, we need to pick which OS we are going to package and run the app on within the container (we would simply use Ubuntu, given its small size and the confirmation it runs well on there). Now, in our Dockerfile we need to write commands that Docker would need in order to set up and run our app. <br><blockquote>FROM ubuntu:18.04</blockquote><br> to set up the image, then run the commands to set up the necessary packages for our app. Because we have already grabbed our required packages into a .txt file, we can next run <br><blockquote>WORKDIR /app<br>
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt<br>
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br>
COPY . .<br>
CMD [“python”, “manage.py”, “uvicorn” “skechwime.asgi:application” “—host” “0.0.0.0” “--port 8000” “--log-level debug”]</blockquote><br>
And now back in our own terminal, we run <br><blockquote>docker build –tag skechwime .</blockquote><br>then we have our image.<br>
To then deploy to the cloud we had to research amongst the cloud computing options and found Heroku to be an interesting and worthwhile option amongst it's competitors. The Heroku platform would allow us to create a reliable and easily manageable environment to work and deploy on. It also allows for us to easily scale the app if we wanted to. As we are using Redis we could also consider their Heroku Data for Redis tool view things such as performance visibility, easy managing of instances and business insights but more research would be needed to be done to see if it's a good fit. As Heroko supports Docker we'd simply use that in combination to easily have container deployment. <br>
As for our database we would be able to make backups, monitor and manage it through Heroku, which allows for easy scaling. Heroku in general would be a great and easy way to simplify the process of deployment along with management while still allowing for a lot of flexibility.
